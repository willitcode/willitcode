### Hello!

My name is Gabe. I'm a programmer and a cybersecurity professional. I've worked extensively in robotics with [FRC Team 937](https://github.com/frc937) and I've spent about a year in the security field, learning and doing CTFs.

I'm also a computer science student at [Colorado College](https://coloradocollege.edu).

You can find out more about me on [my website](https://willitcode.github.io/).
