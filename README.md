### Hello!

My name is Flora. I'm a programmer and a cybersecurity professional. I've worked extensively in robotics with [FRC Team 937](https://github.com/frc937) and I've worked with a variety of companies in security, including some rather high-profile clients.

I'm also a computer science student at [Colorado College](https://coloradocollege.edu).

You can find out more about me on [my website](https://willitcode.github.io/).

#### Contact Me
Email is my preferred method of contact; my address can be found on the left.

I can also be reached on Discord at the same username as this account.
