### Hello!

My name is Gabe. I'm a programmer and a cybersecurity professional. I've worked extensively in robotics with [FRC Team 937](https://github.com/frc937) and I've spent about a year in the security field, learning and doing CTFs.

I've just graduated high school, and I'll be starting at Colorado College as a computer science student this fall.

You can find out more about me on [my website](https://willitcode.github.io/)

#### Contact Me
Email is my preferred method of contact; my address can be found on the left.

I can also be reached on Discord at the same username as this account.
